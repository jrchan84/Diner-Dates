# Diner-Dates
Local Hack Day is an annual 12 hour hackathon hosted by MHL at UBC that allows communities to get first-hand experience bringing ideas to life.
Our team chose to address a topic important to ourselves: reconnecting with meaningful eating. In our busy everyday lives, it sometimes hard to find time away from distractions and concentrate on healthy eating habits. Putting down the phone and eating with family and friends can help us relax and develop important social experiences, especially at younger ages. Hence, we created DinerDates, a platform where users are matched with others with similar food tastes and are given local recommendations for restaurants via the Google Places API. Our goal was to remind our audience about the importance of present, meaningful eating and learn about app devlopment and API's in the process.

Learning:

As this was the first hackathon for all of our team-members, the time-crunch was a big pressure to deal with. We initially wanted to implement our idea as a python webapp as we attended a workshop earlier in the day that taught us the basics. However, we decided to stick to Java and implemented the necessary classes such as Profiles, a PlacesService, and the UI. I primarily contributed to writing the classes and building the UI while my team-mates programmed the PlacesService and connected to the API. We successfully completed our project and presented a Java Application with locally-stored users and working functionality.

Technologies:

Java, JavaFX, JSON, Google Places API
